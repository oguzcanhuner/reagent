# Gabi's Reagent Companion

This is an app designed for people using reagent drug testing kits at home, and for those wondering what testing kit(s) they should be using. This will hopefully allow users to interact with the results of their tests in a less obtuse and more interactive way.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo; have npm/yarn installed; download necessary packages

THEN; because I'm very silly you'll need to run

` yarn start `

and

` yarn sass `


concurrently

## Stuff to be done still

- [ ] Front-end components
- [ ] Routing of app
- [ ] Mass Data Entry
- [ ] Logic for results
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Tighten up copy
- [ ] Shipdat ting
